Build-it Round Submission

Each build-it team should initialize a git repository on either github or bitbucket or gitlab and share it
with the bibifi user on those services. Create a directory named build in the top-level directory of this 
repository and commit your code into that folder. Your submission will be scored after every push to the repository. 
(Beware making your repository public, or other contestants might be able to see it!)

To score a submission, an automated system will first invoke make in the build directory of your submission. The only requirement 
on make is that it must function without internet connectivity, and that it must return within ten minutes. Moreover, it must be 
the case that your software is actually built, through initiation of make, from source (not including libraries you might use). 
Submitting binaries (only) is not acceptable.

Once make finishes, server should be an executable file within the build directory. An automated system will invoke them with a 
variety of options and measure their responses. The executables must be able to be run from any working directory. If your 
executables are bash scripts, you may find the following resource helpful.
